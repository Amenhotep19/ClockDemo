# Clock Demo

This demo was developed by Steve Hannah as part of a tutorial to teach low level graphics programming, this tutorial 
was folded into the [developer guide graphics section](https://www.codenameone.com/manual/graphics.html). We modernized some of the boilerplate code that was improved since the original demo.
